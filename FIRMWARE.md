# Firmware

I'm using [QMK](https://qmk.fm/), it's a keyboard firmware framework but has a ton of features, making it super easy to implement features for louwii-pad, including OLED screen, rotary encoders, RGB lights etc...

The firmware is in a separate repository: [LouWii/qmk_firmware](https://github.com/LouWii/qmk_firmware/tree/louwii-pad), branch `louwii-pad`
