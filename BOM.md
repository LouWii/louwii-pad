# BOM (components list)

I tried to use widely available components to make it as affordable as possible and accessible. No fancy connector made by 1 manufacturer only (well, the only exception to this is the ATmega32u4, but it's one of the best chip for this use, I don't think it's going to be ended soon). That hopefully means we should still be able to find the components in years to come.
